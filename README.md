# Welcome!

### This is my repository for STATS 220! A course I am currently studying.

Here you will find:
* Projects that I have completed **as part of this course**

These are a few reasons why I have *elected to take this course:*
1. Statistics is fascinating!
2. After using R in a previous course (**STATS 201**), I wanted to learn more about it and what I could do with it

If you are interested in STATS 220 and want to know more about the course, check out the course outline *[here](https://courseoutline.auckland.ac.nz/dco/course/STATS/220/1213)*
