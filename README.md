# Welcome!

### This is my repository for STATS 220! A course I am currently studying

Here you will find:
* Projects that I have completed as part of this course

These are a few reasons **why I have elected to take this course:**
1. Statistics is fascinating
2. After using R in a previous course (STATS 201), I wanted to learn more about it

If you are interested in STATS 220 and want to learn more about the course content check out the course outline [here](https://courseoutline.auckland.ac.nz/dco/course/STATS/220/1213)
